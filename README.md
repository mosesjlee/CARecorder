# CARecorder

This is from chapter 4 of the Core Audio book by Chris Adamson and
Kevin Avila. I took their example replaced any of the deprecated functions
and added a metering feature to it that runs on a separate thread.

This is just a learning exercise. The comments are mostly my notes to help
me remember and study
